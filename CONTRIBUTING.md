### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: Do you have development skills? How can you help to improve this app?
- **qa-needed**: Are these frequent questions users may have?
- **documentation-needed**: What kind of information are users required to provide?
- **bug-high-priority**: What kind of bugs are highly prioritized?
- **bug-low-priority**: What kind of bugs are prioritized less?
- **help-wanted**: If you can contribute in any of the former areas, feel free to give your two cents.

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
